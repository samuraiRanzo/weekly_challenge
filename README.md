# weekly_challenge
A dedicated space for continuous improvement through weekly technical challenges. This repository serves as a roadmap of my growth in software architecture, problem-solving, and mastering new frameworks. Each week, I tackle a new project—from system design to complex algorithms—maintaining a strict "one week, one finish" discipline.
