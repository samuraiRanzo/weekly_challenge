## 📅 The January Roadmap: Research & Prep
*Before building, I am dedicating this month to deep-diving into the "Why" and "How" of my 2026 stack.*

- [ ] **Week 01:** Identify Tech Gaps (System Design vs. New Languages)
- [ ] **Week 02:** Tech Stack Selection (Rust vs. Go? Next.js vs. Astro?)
- [ ] **Week 03:** Architecture Planning (Defining the "Gold Standard" for my challenge folders)
- [ ] **Week 04:** Finalizing the 12-Week Sprint List

## 🔭 Learning Objectives for January
*What I am currently researching to prepare for the February start:*

1. **System Design:** Understanding scalable patterns before I write my first line of code.
2. **DevOps:** Setting up a "Base Template" with GitHub Actions to automate my weekly testing.
3. **New Horizons:** Evaluating **[Insert Language/Tool]** for its performance benefits.

## 🛠️ The Challenge "Definition of Done"
*Starting February, every project must meet these criteria:*
* ✅ Fully documented `README.md`
* ✅ Error handling and Edge-case coverage
* ✅ 1-minute video demo or GIF of the final result
* ✅ "Lessons Learned" post-mortem
